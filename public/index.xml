        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/pegasuscover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Project Pegasus" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;major-achievements&#34;&gt;Major Achievements:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pioneered a novel fuel grain composition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Solved emulsification problems between fuel grain ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Developed an modular injector plate, allowing for quick refurbishment in case of damage.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Generated manufacturing procedures to guarantee repeatability and uniformity between fuel grain batches.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Successfully static fired twice, both times gaining N-class impulse classification, outperforming previous generations by 60% in peak thrust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first major project in college, and I was in the position to spearhead an approach to hybrids that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been tried before at UCF. At this point, I had messed around with Paraffin-based fuels on my own small backyard hybrid, but I encountered the typical issues with density, structural stability, and burn stability as every other amateur. I came into this project with the goal of finding a solution to these issues by dedicating a major part of the year to R&amp;amp;D and testing every single approach we could come up with, the Skunkworks Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the previous hybrid projects at UCF all incorporated pyrotechnic valves, with zero control of oxidizer flow after ignition starts. I took it as a challenge to incorporate basic valve control to allow for finetuning of the burn, and most importantly, lay out the framework for in-flight burn control. The importance of being able to control how the motor performs during the flight comes from the ability to pinpoint the target apogee and maximize the points scored within the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-paraffin-problem&#34;&gt;The Paraffin Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, paraffin has its issues, but what are its upsides?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a fuel to burn, it needs to first become a gas in order to react with the oxidizer, much like gasoline vapors are the part that actually burns. In hybrids, depending on the fuel, this mechanism can occur in two different ways, which allows us to separate fuels into two major categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plastic/Rubber (HTPB, ABS, any kind of epoxy, resins, etc.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
For these, there&#39;s no intermediate phase.  Solid immediately turns into gas for combustion. These tend to be more energy dense, stable, and easier to handle. Downside comes down to mixing efficiency.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paraffins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
Paraffin has the unique trait of having an intermediate phase, where it turns into liquid before gasifying when burning. This allows it to develop an unstable liquid layer that flings droplets into the oxidizer stream, giving it an advantage when it comes to energy release and burn efficiency. However, it tends to be softer, prone to cracking, and carries a much lower energy density compared to the others. &lt;b&gt;Also, it won&#39;t withstand much time in the New Mexico Desert during the summer.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could solve paraffin&amp;rsquo;s issues, we&amp;rsquo;d have a great middle ground with room for growth in future projects. My first instinct was to research candlemaking forums, books and every other piece of media I could get my hands on. As a society, we&amp;rsquo;ve been making candles for centuries and have grown pretty good at it. As it turns out, different waxes can increase paraffin&amp;rsquo;s structural stability, melting point, hardness, and alleviate shrinkage/cracking issues. All this research led me towards adding Microcrystalline Wax and Stearic Acid to provide these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final problem comes down to energy density, and this is where Sorbitol comes in. It&amp;rsquo;s a cheap, plentiful diet sugar replacement that&amp;rsquo;s extensively used in amateur solid rocket motors, as well as some hybrids. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to melt and very resilient towards caramelization, which reduces sugar fuels&amp;rsquo; performance. At this point, we came across the age old problem of trying to mix oil with water. See, paraffin is polar and sorbitol is non-polar, meaning we&amp;rsquo;re ending up with a block split into two layers when everything cools down. &lt;b&gt;Suboptimal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where emulsifiers come in. Mayo, for example, is oil and water mixed together, but no one thinks of two layers when thinking of mayo. See, in order for something like that to remain homogeneous, you need a third ingredient in order to &amp;ldquo;interface&amp;rdquo; between the two substances and keep them happy next to each other. In the case of mayonnaise, it&amp;rsquo;s egg. In the case of our fuel mixture? We tried commercial grade emulsifiers and surfactants, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, namely. Pretty similar stuff to shampoo components. Ultimately we arrived at a super high-tech solution: &lt;b&gt;Dawn Dish Soap with Papaya Scent.&lt;/b&gt; Remember, if it&amp;rsquo;s stupid and it works then it&amp;rsquo;s not stupid. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible how effective a tiny bit of Dawn was at homogeinizing the ingredients and keeping them together when everything cooled back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more issue I wanted to solve wasn&amp;rsquo;t really critical but instead a way to appease my lizard brain desire to push past 100%. In order to extract more performance out of this fuel, we need to make the best use out of the energy released by the chemical reaction. This fuel mix ended up being very white and semi-transluscent, traits which aren&amp;rsquo;t ideal for two reasons: white things reflect instead of absorbing, and non-opaque things tend to let light thru them. We need the grain to absorb as much heat from the combusting gases as possible, and we need that heat to remain at the outermost layer of the fuel. In order to achieve this, we want to make the grain opaque somehow, and we want the reacting gases to radiate as much heat as possible. Carbon Black, Lampblack, or Soot was what we chose. Adding just 1-5%wt of Carbon Black to the mix made the fuel completely opaque and it created a very incandescent exhaust as expected, but the kicker was that we got about 10% more thrust out of this simple change. Free performance glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;combustion-chamber&#34;&gt;Combustion Chamber
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going from forward to aft, the major components of a typical hybrid combustion chamber are: Injector Carrier/Forward Closure, Casing, Thermal Liner, Nozzle, Nozzle Retainer. Designs may vary going from system to system but the basic components generally remain the same. While the concept of rocket propulsion remains relatively standard between solids, liquids, and hybrids, hybrids have a few particular quirks that drive the design of the combustion chamber in order to maximize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a liquid engine, for example. Two propellants are injected into the chamber, mixed together and ignited. Straight forward enough. This involves careful timing and geometric design in order to guarantee that your propellants get to know each other as well as possible before they get the chance to burn. Inefficient mixing leads to loss of performance, so the art comes down to the injector design and chamber geometry (as well as other tricks involving preheating or preburning one or both of the propellants, not the focus of this discussion). On the other hand, you&amp;rsquo;ve got solids. Your propellants are mixed together homogeneously during manufacturing, meaning you have a mixture ratio and properties that are essentially set in stone. Major drawback is that potent fuels and oxidizers in close proximity to each other are a recipe for disaster. This is where hybrids come in and attempt to reach a goldilocks spot between these two. Conventionally, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a solid fuel and a liquid or gaseous oxidizer being injected. You still have the simplicity of solids and most of their form factor, but since your propellants are still separate from one another, you have the inherent safety of a liquid platform. The benefits truly end here, as they tend to inherit some of the worst performance issues of either counterpart. They&amp;rsquo;re hard to ignite, since as mentioned above you need to vaporize that fuel in order for it to ignite, which is rendered borderline impossible when your oxidizer is undergoing a phase transition right upstream wicking a lot of your igniter&amp;rsquo;s energy (we&amp;rsquo;ll get into this soon, I promise). It&amp;rsquo;s hard to ignite the whole grain face at once, mixing is a problem because fuel vapors are produced at the inner face of the grain white the oxidizer is injected flowing longitudinally,meaning a boundary layer forms where the two are supposed to be getting to know each other well. Diffusion is the primary mechanism driving mixing, and unfortunately without clever engineering it leads to horrible combustion performance and a ton of unburnt propellants being expelled without reacting. But this is where engineers thrive, with careful consideration, a lot of these issues can be mitigated to turn this into a somewhat tolerable platform for something like a sounding rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started at the forward end with the oxidizer. In Pegasus, the oxidizer of choice is Nitrous Oxide. You might know this as laughing gas, or whippets. It&amp;rsquo;s cheap, plentiful, and most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the family of refrigerant gases. This last feature is a double edged sword, where it can be stored at a relatively low pressure as a liquid, it&amp;rsquo;s self-pressurizing and it&amp;rsquo;s got an awesome density at its ideal storage temperature, also it flashes into a gas the second that pressure drops below a threshold, which serves very well when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get it to atomize and mix with the fuel in the chamber. However, the refrigerant side of things comes in and it will devour all the heat around it in order to support the phase transition, think turning a can of keyboard duster upside down. Additionally, when the fluid speeds up, pressure drops, which leads to two phase flow and cavitation, both of which are headahces in trying to design something to run at steady state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take care of these issues, in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: This did not happen in this narrative order in real life. Truth is, you need the rest of the system to be able to iterate on fuels and hone everything the way portrayed above)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valve-control&#34;&gt;Valve Control
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxidizer flow was controlled by a servo strapped to a ball valve. Simple enough for a team getting into valve control, robust enough not to introduce too much uncertainty into our design. Although we found out real quick what happens when you keep sending position information to an uncooled servo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printed cage around valve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;acknowledgements-and-final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements and Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article highlights primarily the work I was directly spearheading, but ultimately this is all the culmination of a team of equally talented people working towards a common goal. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my peers in the propulsion team for their help getting this from whiteboard drawings up into the air, as well as the people involved in every other supporting subsystem ranging from avionics to aerostuctures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy some pictures from IREC 2023 and the later launch in Florida!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This website is meant to be a living document, with the intention of acting as a personal wiki for my previous, ongoing, and future projects. A digital garden of sorts. One of my 2025 New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions was to put together an updated portfolio showcasing my background for new acquaintances, as well as potential employers. Documentation is a skill every engineer should have, and I deeply believe in the open source mission, so I will be doing my best to explain what&amp;rsquo;s going on inside my head. &lt;b&gt;Beware: thoughts and ideas may be half finished. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to talk about the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, so feel free to reach out! I&amp;rsquo;m more than willing to expand upon anything on this site, particulaly my work with IREC hybrids. My socials are on that sidebar on the left, pick your poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a potential employee, please reach out via e-mail at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;mailto:anegrette@protonmail.com&#34; &gt;anegrette@protonmail.com&lt;/a&gt; or on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-background&#34;&gt;My Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am an Aerospace Engineer &lt;strong&gt;(I graduated!)&lt;/strong&gt; with a background in gas dynamics and propulsion, primarily through collegiate sounding rocketry. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored much of everything that bringing an idea from a napkin drawing to a polished design, including short-run production. I have participated in the &lt;strong&gt;International Rocket Engineering Competition&lt;/strong&gt; for a couple of years, primarily overseeing the development of the hybrid rocket motor for each participating rocket. Pictured is my favorite project, Pegasus. &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/pegasuslaunch.png#floatright&#34;

		alt=&#34;Pegasus Launch!&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My senior design project involved a &lt;strong&gt;Rotating Detonation Engine&lt;/strong&gt;, designed with the intention of contributing to the global understanding of RDEs, as well as creating an air breathing small-scale platform ready to be integrated with a flight vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My machining work experience encompasses 2, 3, and 4 axis CNC machining, as well as resin (DLP) additive manufacturing. Due to my time as a machinist I have developed an intuition for competent design with manufacturing and production in mind. In terms of Additive Manufacturing, I spearheaded the implementation of a Stratasys Origin One Photopolymerization Machine, including the creation of brand new procedures to maximize part repeatability, a critical part of the prototyping work I did for the UCF Machine Shop. I received training directly from Stratasys to maintain and repair the machine and its local print server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the academic and professional lens, I like to spend my free time browsing for obsolete tech on eBay, playing guitar and reading. I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching myself computer and electrical engineering, in part because I feel a Mech/Aero Engineer in the 21st century should be somewhat competent in the computers that support everything we build, and in part because I&amp;rsquo;d like to know how to repair the stuff I buy on eBay. One of my ongoing projects involves a Tang Nano 9k FPGA dev board as a platform for learning digital logic design and Verilog HDL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-site&#34;&gt;The Site
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do NOT have a web dev background, but I had enough brain to cobble together enough readme&amp;rsquo;s and stack overflow google searches to put this together. Built on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hugo Stack Theme&lt;/a&gt;. Immense thanks to people who put their code on the internet for our combined benefit. FOSS rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, whether this attracts employers or not, I just wanted to compile all the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done into one cohesive document. I love this field, and much like a conventional garden is a product of love and care, this is my love note to engineering. Thank you for the visit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/p/image-gallery/2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Image gallery" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo theme Stack supports the creation of interactive image galleries using Markdown. It&amp;rsquo;s powered by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://photoswipe.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PhotoSwipe&lt;/a&gt; and its syntax was inspired by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://typlog.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Typlog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this feature, the image must be in the same directory as the Markdown file, as it uses Hugo&amp;rsquo;s page bundle feature to read the dimensions of the image. &lt;strong&gt;External images are not supported.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/math-typesetting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stack has built-in support for math typesetting using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://katex.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;KaTeX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enabled by default side-wide,&lt;/strong&gt; but you can enable it for individual posts by adding &lt;code&gt;math: true&lt;/code&gt; to the front matter. Or you can enable it side-wide by adding &lt;code&gt;math = true&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;params.article&lt;/code&gt; section in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inline-math&#34;&gt;Inline math
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an inline mathematical expression: $\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887…$&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Create a new hugo website or open your existing hugo site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;add-the-theme-to-your-hugo-site&#34;&gt;Add the theme to your hugo site
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use as a git submodule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme.git themes/digitalgarden
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone the repository (one-off, updating the theme may be harder later):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme.git themes/digitalgarden
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; files from the theme/digitalgarden folder to the root folder of your the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to install required packages for theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm i -g postcss-cli&lt;/code&gt; to use PostCSS with Hugo build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;theme = &#39;digitalgarden&#39;&lt;/code&gt; in config.toml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt; to start your local server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deploying to services like Netlify or Vercel, use the following command for building your site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;npm i -g postcss-cli &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; npm run build
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/articles/structure&#34; &gt;Understanding the theme structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; → Used to decide the order of menu items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;params.header&lt;/code&gt; → Display menu item as header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the link points to an external website, the external icon is already displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The social menu can be used to configure all the social icons in the sidebar. Add links to your social media in the website config to show the icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;social&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Twitter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;https://twitter.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; of the social menu needs to be unique and should be one of the supported values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported values for the social menu item name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastodon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dribbble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codepen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>5. Newsletter</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/newsletter/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/newsletter/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The theme supports a subscription to multiple newsletter providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buttondown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buttondown&#34;&gt;Buttondown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Params.newsletter.provider] = &amp;ldquo;buttondown&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; url from your buttondown admin dashboard and add it to &lt;strong&gt;[Params.newsletter.path]&lt;/strong&gt; in config.toml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.buttondown.email/img/9.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Buttondown share form URL&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;substack&#34;&gt;Substack
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Params.newsletter.provider] = &amp;ldquo;substack&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up substack is the easiest. Just add your substack newsletter URL (applicable for custom domains also) to &lt;strong&gt;[Params.newsletter.path]&lt;/strong&gt; in config.toml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that since substack doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a native API for subscription. The theme uses the api from substackapi.com which is in no way associated to Substack itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revue&#34;&gt;Revue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add your revue &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; URL to &lt;code&gt;Params.newsletter.path&lt;/code&gt; in your config.toml. Once done, the newsletter widget will start showing up in website&amp;rsquo;s sidebar, allowing your visitors to subscribe to your newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-find-your-revue-url-to-use&#34;&gt;How to find your Revue URL to use
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Login to your Revue account and go to to &lt;code&gt;Account Settings&lt;/code&gt;, then the &lt;code&gt;Integrations&lt;/code&gt; tab. Scroll to the bottom, and click on &lt;code&gt;Learn more&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Signup forms&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/304891471/587879182e5d9d19aff97d2f/Screenshot&amp;#43;2021-02-26&amp;#43;at&amp;#43;9.10.32&amp;#43;AM.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Revue signup forms&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next page, you can find the add_subscriber URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme/blob/main/images/revue-signup-form-url.png?raw=true&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Revue URL&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy it and use in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/articles/google-analytics&#34; &gt;Add Google analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital garden theme utilizes the Hugo&amp;rsquo;s [internal template](internal templates) for Google analytics and so both Google analytics v3 and GA v4 (gtag) are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add your &lt;strong&gt;UA-PROPERTY_ID&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;G-MEASUREMENT_ID&lt;/strong&gt; to config.toml&lt;/p&gt;
