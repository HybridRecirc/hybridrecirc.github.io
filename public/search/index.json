[{"content":"Major Achievements: Developed a fully-fledged testing platform for air-breathing RDEs at UCF Laid the foundation for a future senior design teams Produced data for several AIAA SciTech 2025 papers Background Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) are a relatively novel form of rocket propulsion that takes advantage of pressure-gain combustion. Conventional rocket engines use constant-pressure combustion cycles. RDEs theoretically produce better performance by taking better advantage of the energy stored chemically in the propellants. There is a fine line between detonating in the way that yields the performance advantage, and detonating in the way that destroys the engine. Due to the speeds involved in the process, these engines have only recently began gaining traction now that computers and sensors allow for the extremely fast sampling rates necessary for reliable data output. Their compact size allows for storable propellants to be used more effectively in missile and defense applications.\nThe goals of this project at the beginning were beyond creating a working air breathing lab scale engine, to lay the foundation for further research to be done at UCF. This involved creating a test stand equipped with a capable and robust data acquisition system and control system. With the tight budget for a project of this ambition we had to get creative.\nDesign Ignition Lighting an RDE involves precise timing and a strong enough relese of energy to induce a detonation mode within the engine. A fast burst (in tens of micro seconds) with not a lot of energy is more likely to induce a detonation compared to a longer burst with a ton more energy. Typically predets are used where an explosive mixture of gases are lit on one end of a long tube and over that length of tube the energy release is structured in such a way a shock is developed by the time the combusting gases exit. Due to the mechanism of operation, these have careful geometry that is hard to package into a system with compact and flight in mind. This is where my approach comes in, conventional torch. If the annulus can act as the constriction that focuses the energy towards a shock, the igniter can be more compact and allow for smaller designs for flight vehicles.\nHumbled by Testing Senior Design Showcase Future Plans SciTech Final Thoughts and Acknowledgements Taha Dr. Burke, Teammates and UCF\u0026rsquo;s Senior Design Support System\n","date":"2025-05-03T14:50:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/rde.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/project-sabr/","title":"Project SABR"},{"content":"Major Achievements: Pioneered a novel fuel grain composition. Solved emulsification problems between fuel grain ingredients. Developed an modular injector plate, allowing for quick refurbishment in case of damage. Generated manufacturing procedures to guarantee repeatability and uniformity between fuel grain batches. Successfully static fired twice, both times gaining N-class impulse classification, outperforming previous generations by 60% in peak thrust. Background This was my first major project in college, and I was in the position to spearhead an approach to hybrids that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been tried before at UCF. At this point, I had messed around with Paraffin-based fuels on my own small backyard hybrid, but I encountered the typical issues with density, structural stability, and burn stability as every other amateur. I came into this project with the goal of finding a solution to these issues by dedicating a major part of the year to R\u0026amp;D and testing every single approach we could come up with, the Skunkworks Way.\nAdditionally, the previous hybrid projects at UCF all incorporated pyrotechnic valves, with zero control of oxidizer flow after ignition starts. I took it as a challenge to incorporate basic valve control to allow for finetuning of the burn, and most importantly, lay out the framework for in-flight burn control. The importance of being able to control how the motor performs during the flight comes from the ability to pinpoint the target apogee and maximize the points scored within the competition.\nThe Paraffin Problem As mentioned before, paraffin has its issues, but what are its upsides?\nIn order for a fuel to burn, it needs to first become a gas in order to react with the oxidizer, much like gasoline vapors are the part that actually burns. In hybrids, depending on the fuel, this mechanism can occur in two different ways, which allows us to separate fuels into two major categories:\nPlastic/Rubber (HTPB, ABS, any kind of epoxy, resins, etc.) For these, there's no intermediate phase. Solid immediately turns into gas for combustion. These tend to be more energy dense, stable, and easier to handle. Downside comes down to mixing efficiency. Paraffins Paraffin has the unique trait of having an intermediate phase, where it turns into liquid before gasifying when burning. This allows it to develop an unstable liquid layer that flings droplets into the oxidizer stream, giving it an advantage when it comes to energy release and burn efficiency. However, it tends to be softer, prone to cracking, and carries a much lower energy density compared to the others. Also, it won't withstand much time in the New Mexico Desert during the summer. If we could solve paraffin\u0026rsquo;s issues, we\u0026rsquo;d have a great middle ground with room for growth in future projects. My first instinct was to research candlemaking forums, books and every other piece of media I could get my hands on. As a society, we\u0026rsquo;ve been making candles for centuries and have grown pretty good at it. As it turns out, different waxes can increase paraffin\u0026rsquo;s structural stability, melting point, hardness, and alleviate shrinkage/cracking issues. All this research led me towards adding Microcrystalline Wax and Stearic Acid to provide these benefits.\nOur final problem comes down to energy density, and this is where Sorbitol comes in. It\u0026rsquo;s a cheap, plentiful diet sugar replacement that\u0026rsquo;s extensively used in amateur solid rocket motors, as well as some hybrids. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to melt and very resilient towards caramelization, which reduces sugar fuels\u0026rsquo; performance. At this point, we came across the age old problem of trying to mix oil with water. See, paraffin is polar and sorbitol is non-polar, meaning we\u0026rsquo;re ending up with a block split into two layers when everything cools down. Suboptimal.\nThis is where emulsifiers come in. Mayo, for example, is oil and water mixed together, but no one thinks of two layers when thinking of mayo. See, in order for something like that to remain homogeneous, you need a third ingredient in order to \u0026ldquo;interface\u0026rdquo; between the two substances and keep them happy next to each other. In the case of mayonnaise, it\u0026rsquo;s egg. In the case of our fuel mixture? We tried commercial grade emulsifiers and surfactants, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, namely. Pretty similar stuff to shampoo components. Ultimately we arrived at a super high-tech solution: Dawn Dish Soap with Papaya Scent. Remember, if it\u0026rsquo;s stupid and it works then it\u0026rsquo;s not stupid. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how effective a tiny bit of Dawn was at homogeinizing the ingredients and keeping them together when everything cooled back down.\nOne more issue I wanted to solve wasn\u0026rsquo;t really critical but instead a way to appease my lizard brain desire to push past 100%. In order to extract more performance out of this fuel, we need to make the best use out of the energy released by the chemical reaction. This fuel mix ended up being very white and semi-transluscent, traits which aren\u0026rsquo;t ideal for two reasons: white things reflect instead of absorbing, and non-opaque things tend to let light thru them. We need the grain to absorb as much heat from the combusting gases as possible, and we need that heat to remain at the outermost layer of the fuel. In order to achieve this, we want to make the grain opaque somehow, and we want the reacting gases to radiate as much heat as possible. Carbon Black, Lampblack, or Soot was what we chose. Adding just 1-5%wt of Carbon Black to the mix made the fuel completely opaque and it created a very incandescent exhaust as expected, but the kicker was that we got about 10% more thrust out of this simple change. Free performance glitch.\nCombustion Chamber Going from forward to aft, the major components of a typical hybrid combustion chamber are: Injector Carrier/Forward Closure, Casing, Thermal Liner, Nozzle, Nozzle Retainer. Designs may vary going from system to system but the basic components generally remain the same. While the concept of rocket propulsion remains relatively standard between solids, liquids, and hybrids, hybrids have a few particular quirks that drive the design of the combustion chamber in order to maximize performance.\nTake a liquid engine, for example. Two propellants are injected into the chamber, mixed together and ignited. Straight forward enough. This involves careful timing and geometric design in order to guarantee that your propellants get to know each other as well as possible before they get the chance to burn. Inefficient mixing leads to loss of performance, so the art comes down to the injector design and chamber geometry (as well as other tricks involving preheating or preburning one or both of the propellants, not the focus of this discussion). On the other hand, you\u0026rsquo;ve got solids. Your propellants are mixed together homogeneously during manufacturing, meaning you have a mixture ratio and properties that are essentially set in stone. Major drawback is that potent fuels and oxidizers in close proximity to each other are a recipe for disaster. This is where hybrids come in and attempt to reach a goldilocks spot between these two. Conventionally, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a solid fuel and a liquid or gaseous oxidizer being injected. You still have the simplicity of solids and most of their form factor, but since your propellants are still separate from one another, you have the inherent safety of a liquid platform. The benefits truly end here, as they tend to inherit some of the worst performance issues of either counterpart. They\u0026rsquo;re hard to ignite, since as mentioned above you need to vaporize that fuel in order for it to ignite, which is rendered borderline impossible when your oxidizer is undergoing a phase transition right upstream wicking a lot of your igniter\u0026rsquo;s energy (we\u0026rsquo;ll get into this soon, I promise). It\u0026rsquo;s hard to ignite the whole grain face at once, mixing is a problem because fuel vapors are produced at the inner face of the grain white the oxidizer is injected flowing longitudinally,meaning a boundary layer forms where the two are supposed to be getting to know each other well. Diffusion is the primary mechanism driving mixing, and unfortunately without clever engineering it leads to horrible combustion performance and a ton of unburnt propellants being expelled without reacting. But this is where engineers thrive, with careful consideration, a lot of these issues can be mitigated to turn this into a somewhat tolerable platform for something like a sounding rocket.\nGetting started at the forward end with the oxidizer. In Pegasus, the oxidizer of choice is Nitrous Oxide. You might know this as laughing gas, or whippets. It\u0026rsquo;s cheap, plentiful, and most importantly, it\u0026rsquo;s part of the family of refrigerant gases. This last feature is a double edged sword, where it can be stored at a relatively low pressure as a liquid, it\u0026rsquo;s self-pressurizing and it\u0026rsquo;s got an awesome density at its ideal storage temperature, also it flashes into a gas the second that pressure drops below a threshold, which serves very well when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get it to atomize and mix with the fuel in the chamber. However, the refrigerant side of things comes in and it will devour all the heat around it in order to support the phase transition, think turning a can of keyboard duster upside down. Additionally, when the fluid speeds up, pressure drops, which leads to two phase flow and cavitation, both of which are headahces in trying to design something to run at steady state.\nIn order to take care of these issues, in\n(Note: This did not happen in this narrative order in real life. Truth is, you need the rest of the system to be able to iterate on fuels and hone everything the way portrayed above)\nValve Control Oxidizer flow was controlled by a servo strapped to a ball valve.

Problems ranging from just corrosion within a sensor\u0026rsquo;s connector to open heart surgery on a board no longer made. For a glorified sous-vide tank, the Noritsu engineers put a lot of safeguards and smart engineering in place to keep these working as well as they have for as long as they have. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article with the intention of logging whatever I find for whoever takes over for me, or whoever finds this website in similar despair as I have googled whenever something broke. There\u0026rsquo;s also the nice side effect of showing off the stuff between my ears to employers. Anyway.\nThis is the V50, relatively sophisticated MiniLab unit for C-41 Color Development. Short Leader style, which means you tape the film to a sheet of plastic with sprocket holes on it, and that\u0026rsquo;s what drags the film itself out of the can and into each step of the development process. The 50 in V50 stands for 50 rolls an hour, so not too shabby accounting for the fact a 36 exposure roll of film tends to be somewhere around 5 feet.\nIn order to put the rest of the machine in context, let\u0026rsquo;s cover the development steps of Black and White and C-41 film:\nFor both, the film is coated with silver halide crystals. Exactly how they are spread on the film and what they do during and after the development process varies between B/W, C-41, and every other development process available, but the working principle remains the same. After being exposed to light, these crystals are raised to a higher energy level, leaving a latent image stored chemically on the film emulsion.\nB/W: -Developer: This step converts the latent image contained in the activated silver halide into metallic silver. This metallic silver only appears in the locations where light struck the emulsion. The stronger the light, the more concentrated the silver, the darker or \u0026ldquo;denser\u0026rdquo; the image is at this location, and the reverse applies as well. All of this to say that we now have a negative image of what was captured in the camera at that moment.\n-Fixer: After the developer, the image that matters to us is created. However, it\u0026rsquo;s still surrounded by the inactive silver halides still in the emulsion. No light, no developer action, no metallic silver. The fixer can dissolve the halides but not metallic silver, which allows us to selectively remove the unused stuff and keep our image negative.\nEasy stuff, we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing monochrome stuff essentially as long as we have been able to reliably understand organic chemistry. B/W film made a year ago and 80 years ago work the exact same, and excluding the effects of age, can be developed the exact same way. Color, however, is where modernity truly shines through. Kudos to all the chemists and engineers that allowed us to record the world around us in more than shadows and highlights.\nC-41: -Developer: Still does the same as B/W, with the caveat that now the dye couplers (part that creates the colors) are activated and create the dyes of each layer. Fun fact, you can cross-process any C-41 roll as B/W, you just ignore the color couplers for a monochrome image. I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to salvage pictures from obsolete C-22 rolls from 60+ years ago. Hard drives fail, files go corrupt, but in a decently wide range of conditions, chemistry prevails. Cool stuff.\n-Bleach: Due to the layout of a typical C-41 film emulsion, after development, you now have both a dye-based image, and the metallic silver image. Keeping both of these leads to super dense images with low saturation, and often it was used intentionally as a color grading effect in movies and TV in a method called \u0026ldquo;bleach bypass\u0026rdquo;. The bleach attacks this metallic image and converts it back to silver halides, which can now be removed by the fixer. It also helps reducing the density of the dyes in the film base.\n-Fixer: Same as B/W. Fixer actually holds quite a decent amount of silver, so it\u0026rsquo;s very important to dispose of properly and feed it to silver reclaiming facilities. Not that any other chemical is great for carelessly dumping into the environment, but the fixer carries metals with it that are specially bad to introduce into an ecosystem.\n-Stabilizer: The dyes contained on each layer are technically not fixed in space, and age, environmental factors, and improper handling of the film can lead to them migrating between layers. The end effect is a reduction in the color reproduction quality, so stabilizers are used to \u0026ldquo;lock\u0026rdquo; the dyes out of escaping their layer. You can very well skip this step if you are just looking for a glorified Instagram filter, but in order to produce negatives that can withstand the test of time, stabilization is crucial.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to get into detail about the careful design of color emulsions, but so have another 500 trillion people on the internet, so I will unfortunately not elaborate here. Google it, watch Tech Connections about it, don\u0026rsquo;t use this case of brevity as an excuse to avoid learning about film.\nOur machine feeds the leader card and the film it\u0026rsquo;s attached to into a very deep 18 Liter Color Developer (CD) tank at a speed that allows for each length of film to be in contact with the CD solution, while automatically adding a replenishment amount of fresh chemical to account for exhaustion per roll. All the chemicals involved in these reactions are disposable and need to be replenished accounting for the surface area that passes through. The film is continued to be carried in and out of the solutions automagically by careful mechanical design of roller transports like conveyors through a factory. The machine doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually know where this film is, but it vaguely knows when it started being fed and when the canister was cut off at the end, and it knows how fast everything is spinning and moving the film along. So it starts counting and can make an educated guess as to where it\u0026rsquo;d be and what chemicals would be exhausted at which times.\nAt the end, it passes through essentially a gentler air fryer before being released fully dry for it to be scanned and/or sleeved for preservation. Almost magical coming from my background of hanging up film from my shower curtain loops.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve neglected to mention much about the modified V30 that develops B/W, but it\u0026rsquo;s the same principles and same tech, just behaving differently to accomodate for the different chemistry. Both operate the same. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s get into it.\nMost Recent: Color Developer Working Tank Overheating Symptoms: Intermitent S-Sol Thermo Activated Error\nSolution reaches 43C before other safeguards kick in\nInitially only happened during overnight sleep cycle\nInitial Troubleshooting: Compared thermocouple readings to thermometer in working tank and in side tank (will elaborate on tank layout in a second) \u0026ndash; Temp Matches\nDrained tank, cleaned agitation and recirculation pumps \u0026ndash; Minor to Negligible Improvement\nFor context, we had just recovered from the below problem of the cutter jamming\nWhen I came back to the machine, I noticed that although the troubleshooting LEDs on the machine showed the control unit was not powering the heater relay, temperature continued to climb. Coming from the car background, tapping around with the rubber back of a screwdriver didn\u0026rsquo;t help. Turns out SSR stands for Solid State Relay, something I realized pretty late, embarassingly late. The awesome engineers at Noritsu had the foresight of including redundant relays on the board, or rather, populating relay footprints for heater circuits not used in this machine model. I\u0026rsquo;m sure the V100 or the V5Billion use these relays, but I\u0026rsquo;m lucky mine doesn\u0026rsquo;t because these exact P/Ns are looooooong discontinued. In my panic before realizing there were spares I did find a suitable drop-in replacement. Here\u0026rsquo;s the link in case you\u0026rsquo;re not so lucky to have a relay cache on your board. I would like the record to show that I called it early on.\nWorld\u0026rsquo;s oldest solder\nYeah. Looking at the board closer would\u0026rsquo;ve saved quite a bit of time. If you noticed the missing pad, you try to babysit a board like this into releasing a component and tell me how it goes. It\u0026rsquo;s like they glued it on like a postage stamp.\nCutter Jams Symptoms: Right Lane Struggled to Cut Canister at the End of the roll Canisters stuck after cutting Cutter Return Error Initial Troubleshooting Initially,\n","date":"2025-05-03T14:50:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/rde.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/noritsu-v50/","title":"How to Cope with Being a Film Lab Tech"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
