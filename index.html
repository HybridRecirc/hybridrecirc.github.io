            <p>One of my 2025 New Year's resolutions was to finally have an updated portfolio outlining my projects accessible to friends and new acquaintances, 
              as well as potential employers. The goal of this website is to showcase the work that I have done throughout my undergraduate degree.</p>
            <p>Additionally, this website will also function as a living journal of the things that I am actively working on, with an emphasis on documentation and 
              open sourcing my findings, heavily inspired by <strong>Nakka Rocketry.</strong></p>
            <p>This is a journal website presenting my thought processes in the form of project documentation, <strong>so expect the tone to be informal and lighthearted.</strong></p>

        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p><strong>Please read this first!</strong></p>

        

        <p>I am an Aerospace Engineer <strong>(I graduated!)</strong> with a background in gas dynamics and propulsion, primarily through collegiate sounding rocketry. 
          Although, don't get it wrong, I'm well versed much more, particularly R&D and test engineering. Everything that bringing an idea from a napkin drawing entails 
          I have probably explored either professionally or in my own time, as you'll see throughout this site.
          I have participated in the <strong>International Rocket Engineering Competition</strong> for a couple of years, 
          primarily overseeing the development of the hybrid rocket motor for each participating rocket. Pictured on the right is my favorite project, Pegasus. 
          <strong><a href="projects/pegasus.html"> Click here to learn more!</a></strong> </p>
        
        <p>My senior design project involved a <strong>Rotating Detonation Engine</strong>, designed with the intention of contributing to the global understanding of RDEs, 
          as well as creating an air breathing small-scale platform ready to be integrated with a flight vehicle. More on this can be found here: PLACEHOLDER </p>
        
        <p>My machining work experience encompasses 2, 3, and 4 axis CNC machining, as well as resin (DLP) additive manufacturing. From my time as a machinist 
          I have developed an intuition for competent design with manufacturing and production in mind. In terms of AM, I spearheaded the integration of a Stratasys Origin One Photopolymerization Machine, 
          including the creation of brand new procedures to maximize part repeatability, a critical part of the prototyping work I did for the UCF Machine Shop. I received training directly
          from Stratasys to maintain and repair the machine as well as the local printer network hardware.</p>
                
        <p>Beyond the purely engineering experience stuff, I like to spend my free time browsing for obsolete tech on eBay, playing guitar and reading. 
          I've been teaching myself electrical engineering, in part because I feel a Mech/Aero Engineer in 2025 should be somewhat competent in the computers that support everything we build, 
          and in part because I'd like to know how to repair the stuff I buy on eBay.
          I like to collect physical music, mainly cassettes and MiniDisc. I love the 00s and 10s, hence this website's design. </p>

          <strong>Much more info on all of this can be found in my Projects and Hobbies sites, take a look!</strong>
