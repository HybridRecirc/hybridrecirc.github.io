## Foreword

This website is meant to be a living document, with the intention of acting as a personal wiki for my previous, ongoing, and future projects. One of my 2025 New Year's resolutions was to put together an updated portfolio showcasing my background for new acquaintances, as well as potential employers. Documentation is a skill every engineer should have, and I deeply believe in the open source mission, so I will be doing my best to explain what's going on inside my head. <b>Beware: thoughts and ideas may be half finished. </b>

I love to talk about the stuff I've worked on, so feel free to reach out! I'm more than willing to expand upon anything on this site, particulaly my work with IREC hybrids. My socials are on that sidebar on the left, pick your poison.

Now, if you're looking for a potential employee, please reach out via e-mail at anegrette@protonmail.com or on LinkedIn.

## My Background

I am an Aerospace Engineer <strong>(I graduated!)</strong> with a background in gas dynamics and propulsion, primarily through collegiate sounding rocketry. I've explored much of everything that bringing an idea from a napkin drawing to a polished design, including short-run production. I have participated in the <strong>International Rocket Engineering Competition</strong> for a couple of years, primarily overseeing the development of the hybrid rocket motor for each participating rocket. Pictured is my favorite project, Pegasus. ![Pegasus Launch!](/pegasuslaunch.png#floatright)
        
My senior design project involved a <strong>Rotating Detonation Engine</strong>, designed with the intention of contributing to the global understanding of RDEs, as well as creating an air breathing small-scale platform ready to be integrated with a flight vehicle. 

My machining work experience encompasses 2, 3, and 4 axis CNC machining, as well as resin (DLP) additive manufacturing. Due to my time as a machinist I have developed an intuition for competent design with manufacturing and production in mind. In terms of Additive Manufacturing, I spearheaded the implementation of a Stratasys Origin One Photopolymerization Machine, including the creation of brand new procedures to maximize part repeatability, a critical part of the prototyping work I did for the UCF Machine Shop. I received training directly from Stratasys to maintain and repair the machine and its local print server.
                
Beyond the academic and professional lens, I like to spend my free time browsing for obsolete tech on eBay, playing guitar and reading. I've been teaching myself computer and electrical engineering, in part because I feel a Mech/Aero Engineer in the 21st century should be somewhat competent in the computers that support everything we build, and in part because I'd like to know how to repair the stuff I buy on eBay. One of my ongoing projects involves a Tang Nano 9k FPGA dev board as a platform for learning digital logic design and Verilog HDL.
